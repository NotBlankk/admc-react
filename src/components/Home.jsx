            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            introduction Farming may be defined as a farming without chemicals
            and relies on varied farming system based on agro-ecology, that
            integrates crops, trees and livestock. Natural farming allows the
            optimum use of functional biodiversity, which encourages the use of
            on-farm inputs prepared by the farmers, and the indigenous breed of
            cow (Desi cow) are preferred and plays a vital role in natural
            farming system. Other cattles dung and urine can also be used for
            preparation of concoctions which builds on natural or ecological
            processes that exist in or around farms.
            <h2>Concept of Natural Farming</h2>
            Concept of Natural FarmingIt is a diversified farming system that
            integrates crops, trees and livestock, allowing the optimum use of
            functional biodiversity. Natural Farming if done effectively
            enhances farmers’ income while delivering many other benefits, such
            as restoration of soil fertility and environmental health, and
            mitigating and/or reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Natural Farming
            builds on natural or ecological processes that exist in or around
            farms. Features of Natural Farming According to natural farming
            principles, plants get 98% of their supply of nutrients from the
            air, water, and sunlight. And the remaining 2% can be fulfilled by
            good quality soil with plenty of friendly microorganisms. (Just like
            in forests and natural systems) The soil is always supposed to be
            covered with organic mulch, which creates humus and encourages the
            growth of friendly microorganisms. Farm made bio-cultures named
            ‘Jeevamrit, Beejamrit etc.’ are added to the soil instead of any
            fertilizers to improve microflora of soil. Jeevamrit, Beejamrit are
            derived from very little cow dung and cow urine of desi cow breed.
            It holds the promise of enhancing farmers’ income while delivering
            many other benefits, such as restoration of soil fertility and
            environmental health, and mitigating and/or reducing greenhouse gas
            emissions. The system requires cow dung and cow urine (Gomutra)
            obtained from Indian breed cow only. Desi cow is apparently the
            purest as far as the microbial content of cow dung, and urine goes.
            In natural farming, neither chemical nor organic fertilizers are
            added to the soil. In fact, no external fertilizers are added to
            soil or given to plants whatsoever. In natural farming,
            decomposition of organic matter by microbes and earthworms is
            encouraged right on the soil surface itself, which gradually adds
            nutrition in the soil, over the period. In natural farming there is
            no plowing, no tilting of soil and no fertilizers, and no weeding is
            done just the way it would be in natural ecosystems. Natural,
            farm-made pesticides like Dashparni ark and Neem Astra are used to
            control pests and diseases. Weeds are considered essential and used
            as living or dead mulch layer. Multi-cropping is encouraged over
            single crop method.
            <h2>Principles of Natural Farming</h2>
            In natural farming chemical or organic fertilizers are not added
            into the soil in fact, decomposition of organic matter by microbes
            and earthworms is encouraged right on the soil surface itself, which
            gradually adds nutrition in the soil, over the period. In natural
            farming plowing,tilting of soil and weeding is not done and it
            remains in a way, just like in natural ecosystems.Healthy soil
            microbiome is the key to retaining and enhancing soil organic
            matter. Concoctions are necessary to enhance the fertility of soil.
            There are different ways of making concoctions. In India, the most
            popular concoctions are based on fermentation of animal dung and
            urine, and uncontaminated soil like Jeevamrit, Beejamrit,
            Ghanjeevamrit etc.
            <h2>Scope of Natural Farming</h2>
            There are many working models of natural farming all over the world,
            the zero budget natural farming (ZBNF) is the most popular model in
            India. Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat are the leading
            States and other States like UP, MP, Odisha, Chatisgarh and UK are
            also promoting natural farming. Due to diverse agro climate and
            strength of traditional knowledge, practicing farmers there are lot
            of scopes for taking up natural farming in our country. Natural
            Farming improves soil fertility, environmental health as well as
            helps in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and also promises
            the enhancement of farmer’s income. In broad terms, Natural Farming
            can be considered as a prominent strategy to save the planet Earth
            for future generations. It has the potential to manage the various
            farmland practices and hence sequester the atmospheric carbon in the
            soils and plants, to make it available for plants.
            <h2>Importance of Natural Farming</h2>
            Several studies have reported the effectiveness of natural farming
            in terms of increase in production, sustainability, saving of water
            use, improvement in soil health and farmland ecosystem. It is
            considered as a cost- effective farming practices with scope for
            raising employment and rural development. Natural Farming offers a
            solution to various problems, such as food insecurity, farmers’
            distress, and health problems arising due to pesticide and
            fertilizer residue in food and water, global warming, climate change
            and natural calamities. It also has the potential to generate
            employment, thereby stemming the migration of rural youth. Natural
            Farming, as the name suggests, is the art, practice and,
            increasingly, the science of working with nature to achieve much
            more with less.
